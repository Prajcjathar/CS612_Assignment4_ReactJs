    <p> In our modern society, we either pay an extravagant amount of money to enjoy just one night being blanketed by the stars, we put the charges on our credit card or we hike for miles for a camping site. However, have you considered skylights?
        A skylight is where you will invest a little so you and your family can marvel at the beauty of nature from the comfort of your own home. Some prefer a traditional way of having a skylight, with wooden paneling and an exquisite Hogwarts style roof while others prefer a more modern take.
        A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for an individual, group or family. It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, 
        where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. </p>
    
  <p><b>History</b>
  The earliest homes that humans inhabited were likely naturally occurring features such as caves.
  The first early hominid ever found in Africa, the Taung Child in 1924, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being preyed upon by an eagle. However, this is now debated.[6] Caves do form in the dolomite of the Ghaap Plateau, including
  the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age site of Wonderwerk Cave; however, the caves that form along the escarpment's edge, like that hypothesised for the Taung Child,are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called tufa.

  <b>Modern Home</b>
  Modernist architects chose to create homes that showed a distinct lack of ornament and flair, in contrast to what was seen in the popular home designs of the time. They designed homes that featured a strong horizontal composition with large open floor plans, intentional asymmetry,
  and large expanses of glass windows or glass walls. The focus here was to create a simplified home with an emphasis on function – removing unnecessary details and frills. As a result, many of these homes were designed to blur the boundaries between the indoors and outdoors. 
  They used the surrounding area to enhance the features of the home, using the lines of the roof or cantilevers to continue the lines of the landscape around the home. As modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe stated: “Nature, too, shall live its own life. 
  We must be aware not to disrupt it with the color of our houses and interior fittings. Yet we should attempt to bring nature, houses and human beings together into a higher unity.”
  Mid-century modern style is an offshoot of traditional modernism using many of the same key features that modernist architects developed, but it’s typically reserved for interior design styles. Some key qualities associated with this style are square homes
  with flat roofs, a monochromatic color palette, and low-key furnishings with a simple and distinct attention to minimalism while avoiding a stark, cold feeling.

  In Western architecture, a living room, also called a lounge room (Australian English), lounge, hall (British English), sitting room (British English), or drawing room, is a room in a residential 
  house or apartment for relaxing and socializing. Such a room is sometimes called a front room when it is near the main entrance at the front of the house. In large, formal homes, a sitting room is often a small 
  private living area adjacent to a bedroom, such as the Queen's Sitting Room and the Lincoln Sitting Room of the White House. The term living room was coined in the late 19th or early 20th century.
