    <p>Terraces are used primarily for leisure activity such as sitting, strolling, or resting.The term often applies to a raised area in front of a monumental
       building or structure, which is usually reached by a grand staircase and surrounded by a balustrade.[2] A terrace may be supported by an embankment or solid 
       foundation, either natural or man-made. Terraces may also be platforms, supported by columns but without the space below filled in,[1] but terraces are always
       open to the sky and may or may not be paved.</p>
    <p>Architectural theories for the use and design of terraces varies widely geographically and historically. In the early part of the 20th century, 
       architects Henry and Theodore Hubbard argued that the basic function of a terrace was as an interesting base of an even more interesting building. 
       Since the terrace was not the focal point of the structure, its design should be simple and it should command a view.[10] More recently, architect Catherine Dee has noted that the terrace is most commonly used to link the structure to the landscape and as an extension of living space.
       According to architect Sophia Psarra, the terrace is one of the most commonly used forms of architecture in the 21st century, along with entrance halls, stairs, and corridors
